## 100 days of Commits pledge
I pledge to commit to 100 days of commits on github. I will post the commit I make each day to github and post a screenshot of my commit on Twitter or Instagram with the hashtag #100daysofcommits.

I pledge this as a promise to myself to set aside time to work on my personal projects and build new skills that I'm personally interested in.
